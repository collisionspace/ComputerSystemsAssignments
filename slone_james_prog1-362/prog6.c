 * Programming Assignment: #6 main.c
 * Instructor: Richard Fox
 * This program we are implementing a chained hashing. There is 2 arrays of linked
 * list - one has unsorted linked lists and the other has sorted linked lists.
 * There will be 1000 random ints 0 to int max (32767) generated and then hashed by
 * array length.  This will determine what index in the arrays it should go to.
 * Once at the index in the arrays it will insert the random number into the linked
 * list. The insert will be either at the front or sorted until it arrives at the correct
 * spot. Both arrays will have counters to track the average insert time.
 * Next it will search the linked lists for a random number 0 to 999, this will 
 * continue for 5000 iterations. At the end of each cycle it will return the location
 * where the random number was found. Each cycle of searching will increment the counters for both arrays.
 * This will be used to calculate the average search time for each list. It will then
 * search through one of the arrays to find the shortest and longest linked list.
 * A summary will be printed to the console - telling the user the array size,
 * shortest & longest linked list, insert average for unordered and ordered linked list,
 * search average for unordered and ordered linked list, and general average for
 * unordered and ordered linked list. It will then deallocate all heap memory for each array.
